## My process
I've started from building a html content, with proper divs. Then css properties and at the end media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

My first using of media queries. I've learned how to write basic media quieries syntax like @media screen and max/min-width properties.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
}
```
### Continued development

In the future I want to improve my skills in RWD.

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

From @correlucas (frontendmentor.io):
1. I should use max/min-width of container for better RWD, instead of fixed width property.
2. I should use picture tag instead of solo img or background-image in CSS. Here is documentation of it: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp.
3. I should use flexbox on for example semantic's tags, instead of creating additionals divs containers. It could shrink my HTML code.
